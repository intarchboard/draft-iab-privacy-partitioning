This is the respective text from RFC6973:\r\nsee https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6973#section-6.1.4\r\n\r\n```\r\n6.1.4  Data Minimization within Identity Management\r\n\r\n   Modern systems are increasingly relying on multi-party transactions\r\n   to authenticate individuals.  Many of these systems make use of an\r\n   identity provider that is responsible for providing AAA functionality\r\n   to relying parties that offer some protected resources.  To\r\n   facilitate these functions, an identity provider will usually go\r\n   through a process of verifying the individual's identity and issuing\r\n   credentials to the individual.  When an individual seeks to make use\r\n   of a service provided by the relying party, the relying party relies\r\n   on the authentication assertions provided by its identity provider.\r\n   Note that in more sophisticated scenarios the authentication\r\n   assertions are traits that demonstrate the individual's capabilities\r\n   and roles.  The authorization responsibility may also be shared\r\n   between the identity provider and the relying party and does not\r\n   necessarily need to reside only with the identity provider.\r\n\r\n   Such systems have the ability to support a number of properties that\r\n   minimize data collection in different ways:\r\n\r\n      In certain use cases, relying parties do not need to know the real\r\n      name or date of birth of an individual (for example, when the\r\n      individual's age is the only attribute that needs to be\r\n      authenticated).\r\n\r\n      Relying parties that collude can be prevented from using an\r\n      individual's credentials to track the individual.  That is, two\r\n      different relying parties can be prevented from determining that\r\n      the same individual has authenticated to both of them.  This\r\n      typically requires identity management protocol support as well as\r\n      support by both the relying party and the identity provider.\r\n\r\n      The identity provider can be prevented from knowing which relying\r\n      parties an individual interacted with.

This is especially important for metadata which have unintentionally been spread to more entities than functionally needed in the past. \r\n> \r\n> Looking further at the data that is requested by a service to function, and not only unintentionally revealed metadata, different services of course have different requirements. Some services do require a user identity, e.g. by creating a user account. Other services currently use existing identifiers like the IP address to create a notion of identity, e.g. to rate-limit access to a certain service or track their service usage. Particularly, in these cases there is a desire to minimize the number of entities that can identify the user. However, just concealing any identifying data by partitioning can impact the service function.\r\n> \r\n> In these cases privacy partitioning can be \u201cused\u201d together with attestation where a known trusted entity that can access a user\u2019s identity can attest a certain characteristic or property of the user without revealing the identity.\r\n> \r\n> ToDo: Given an example?\r\n> ",

This acts at all layers of the stack, with some layers providing less linkability as a result of them maybe being shared with others (IP address, MAC address maybe, device fingerprints, based on hardware and software choices) that might be unique when considered in totality, whereas others provide absolute linkability (per-client cookies).\r\n\r\nI don't know how much existing work can be pointed to on this point, but it's a central piece of the overall thesis you are tackling here.\r\n",

The use of a third party identity\r\nprovider would allow for privacy partitioning by having the identity provider attesting service\r\naccess rights or other relevant user characteristics in an anonymous way. However, today use of\r\nthe centralized system rather lead to an even larger centralization of data as user activity is\r\nnot sufficiently revealed from the identity management system, and identity is not anonymized by\r\nthe management system.\r\n```",

Not sure if that even works that way because all of the protocols have a certain use case and if you have a different use case you might need yet another protocol applying the same design principle however. Don't know.\r\n\r\nI guess we could talk about more about the uses cases that these protocols have been developed for.
